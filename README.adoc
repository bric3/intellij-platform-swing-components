= IntelliJ Platform Swing Components

The goal of this project is to build a library of UI components
for the IntelliJ Platform, since IntelliJ is based on Swing, these
components are pure Swing but may use IntelliJ specific APIs.

The primary language is Kotlin, but using these components from Java
should be supported, if not then it's an API bug.

== Demo of these components is provided via the demo plugin.

Run the `:components-demo-plugin:runIde` task to launch the demo plugin.

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew :components-demo-plugin:runIde
----

Or the shipped run configuration _demo-plugin [runIde]_ for IntelliJ IDEA.

== Tests

I don't exactly know how to test Swing components at this time,
so this part is skipped for now. This is definitely an area that
needs help.
