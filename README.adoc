= IntelliJ Platform Swing Components

The goal of this project is to build a library of UI components
for the IntelliJ Platform, since IntelliJ is based on Swing, these
components are pure Swing but may use IntelliJ specific APIs.

The primary language is Kotlin, but using these components from Java
should be supported, if not then it's an API bug.

== Demo of these components is provided via the demo plugin.

Run the `:components-demo-plugin:runIde` task to launch the demo plugin.

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew :components-demo-plugin:runIde
----

Or the shipped run configuration _demo-plugin [runIde]_ for IntelliJ IDEA.

== Components

* `ScaledJBTable` ans `ScaledTableView` fix an issue regarding the row height
when using custom renderer and switching back and forth between presentation mode.
+ Compare without fix and with the fix:

.Presentation mode *before* fix

.Presentation mode *after* fix

.Zoom at 150% *before* fix

+
.Zoom at 150% *after* fix

* `ColoredProgressBar`, it allows using a custom color for the progress bar,
the `JProgressBar` with the regular DarculaUI does not allow that.

== Tests

I don't exactly know how to test Swing components at this time,
so this part is skipped for now. This is definitely an area that
needs help.
